Junior Software Developer,-1,"If you want to work with an exceptional group of people, in a great location, with numerous benefits and a terrific corporate culture—your are on the right page.

Acro Media is looking for a Junior Software Developer to develop Drupal 8 and Commerce builds. Someone who can code like it’s their native tongue but still talk to our crew comfortably and sometimes even the odd client.

We consider ourselves a laid-back bunch but driven to do well for our customers. We’re looking for low egos and high skills. You can be young and inexperienced or a savvy veteran, what we’re really looking for is your ability to code, which may be finely honed skill or raw talent at this point.

We aren't looking to stick you in a corner with headphones on and call you “the IT department”. Developers own this joint; we get it. If you’re desperate to break free from that office life where you co-workers have never even heard of Minecraft, and want to come on board to build kick-ass commerce sites, corporate gems, and the occasional game, keep reading.

As the successful candidate, here are some things you’ll be responsible for:
Producing high quality work adhering to Acro Media standards and following the Acro Media production process
Implementing updates & revisions to web sites
Contributing code back to the Drupal community, testing and responding to issues, maintaining modules.
Working independently on multiple smaller tasks or larger builds with shifting priorities and tight deadlines
Adhering to and providing accurate estimates for the amount of time required to repair a defect, a build, or to add additional functionality to an existing application
Providing efficient solutions in a timely manner for work requests, issues, and defects
Communicating well with Account Managers, Supervisors, and Clients in regards to work requests, problems and defects
Acting as both a peer/mentor to other Developers as well as be comfortable asking for help from team members
The successful applicant will have:
Ability to find and fix problems in code, this might not be your code and your only hint might be a cryptic complaint from a client.
A good mix of web development skills, you should be able to build out site template and then code all the gears and pulleys behind the scenes as well, we try not to have people who do all HTML/CSS and people who do all backend coding, we like people who can multi-class. You’re not going to work on the same thing for 8 months. If you only have experience on embedded systems or just design sexy layouts, maybe try to brush up on your weaker areas, we are open minded though so don’t let this scare you away.
Our designers use Photoshop, so when you’re building out the templates, it’s good to know how to navigate around this application. Basic knowledge of how layers work, and the use of some the more important tools that are required for taking apart the design and deriving all the images for web-use is a plus.
We're open to good programmers who know other languages and technologies and are willing to learn, but below is a list of a bunch of stuff we normally work with:
Has some coding work to send us
PHP
SQL
CSS3/HTML5
Javascript/jQuery
XML
Bonus: C++/Objective C/C#/C
If you know other languages don’t forget to mention them. If you are a badass Lisp hacker type, mention that.
Comfortable working in a Linux shell to do day-to-day tasks. Hopefully, you have installed Linux on something at least once, even if it was just your Xbox, phone...or vacuum etc. (For real, though, you can get Linux installed on a Roomba)
Some understanding of Linux hosting if at all possible. Have you configured your own server? Did you setup a web server for your house or friends, even if no one else really cared?
Prior experience with a source control system (ex, SVN, Git, GitHub, etc.)
Formal education or prior experience is NOT required, we just want to know that you can code, so you’ll have to have some work you can show us.

Software Developer,CA$78K-CA$90K (Glassdoor est.),"HEY THERE VANCOUVER!

""Who is Voxter?"" You may be asking, well say farewell to Kansas Dorothy, because this might just blow you away.

We're a Vancouver based VOIP company that is on the rise and we are enthusiastically chucking out the old methods of business communication and replacing them with our shiny new platform and sophisticatedly simple software - which has been rocking the world of our business clients since we launched with our first customer in 2005. In short, we make business communication run smoother than a fresh jar of skippy.

Since 2005 we’ve grown to have hundreds of clients across the globe. We have POPs in San Jose, London, Tokyo, LA, Melbourne, Chicago, Toronto, and Vancouver (to name a few). Our goal is not only to continue to expand (we aim for world domination!), but to shake up how the world looks at business telecom and create an experience that our clients actually love to use!

Having been recently acquired by Ooma Inc, we’re poised for growth and ready to build out our already passionate and dedicated team.

And well, we’re hiring! We’re looking for a smart, critical thinker who is able to pick things up quickly to join the Engineering team as a Software Engineer. We’re not an ordinary company, so we don’t expect you to be ordinary either. If you love learning new stuff, enjoy digging into hard work and making the impossible happen - keep on reading!

SOUNDS NEAT, BUT WHAT WILL I DO IN THIS ROLE?

You'll be responsible for building and maintaining new and existing features in our distributed service architecture. We continue to build new features on top of a modern stack - it consists of a database layer (CouchDB), an application layer (Kazoo https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo and a number of other individual applications), an audio transcoding/call routing layer (FreeSWITCH), and an SBC/proxy layer (Kamailio). Many parts of this stack are written in the programming language Erlang. Communications between components is often over the AMQP protocol; specifically, we use RabbitMQ. In this role, you will spend most of your development time on Kazoo or the other peripherals in the application layer. This will include some front-end development as necessary (largely in AngularJS). We value moving fast and responding to change quickly, so don’t hesitate to propose adoption of new technologies that help us deliver value and functionality to our customers.
Of course, sometimes you might have to spend some time on a cool side-project! Some examples of projects members of our team have built include a fitness data aggregation application to encourage staff health activities, a Chrome browser extension that takes advantage of our platform APIs, or a Mario Kart 64 race stats collector!

Sound like you? Might be time for you to put your headphones on and snuggle down to code with your favourite office dog, or grab a pair programming partner, and code away the afternoon…

We have a talented engineering team  - people of all walks of life working on different projects. It’s like in a pirate ship, we may be a bunch of lunatics but we work as one, we pay attention and motivate each other, and often end the day with a good laugh. After all, you’re gonna need a team you can count on!

WHAT SHOULD MY BACKGROUND BE?
Associate's Degree or Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Business Information Systems, or similar field, or equivalent work experience required.
3+ years of development experience
Strong understanding of a typical full-service stack
Ability to perform code reviews, create detailed plans and willingness to work collaboratively with a development team.

Familiar with both following and leading Agile / Scrum process
WHO DO I NEED TO BE TO KICK ASS IN THIS ROLE?
You love problem solving, puzzles and anything that makes you scratch your head!
You’re a coder with a good few years experience building stuff, but who isn’t afraid to learn, try new things, and challenge the status quo. Ideally you’ve got some experience in modern usages of multiple languages and frameworks (we use a lot of Erlang!). You use frameworks like AngularJS or RabbitMQ if they accelerate your work. You might have an embarrassing history with PHP , Bash, Python or Ruby. You’re intensely interested in the latest in cloud platforms, and you probably find time in your day to play with things like Elasticsearch. Maybe you’ve spent some time working with real-time distributed systems. Bonus points if you actually use these tools today, but if you don’t we’re happy to teach you.
You’ve got a few projects under your belt, and you’ve made some mistakes. We value people who learn from mistakes and improve themselves in tiny ways every day. But of course you don’t make the same mistakes over and over again because you know how to use automated tests and production monitoring to catch them next time around ;)
You might have your own side projects which display your love for tinkering, trying and learning new things. You’re also active in the open source community, have a github account and are excited to share with us some of the projects you’ve been working on!
You know how to get your work done without being micro-managed, because you use your initiative to do the right things at the right time. You love taking ownership of the problem and solution, collaborating and seeing it through to delivering value.
You value code accuracy, organization, and vetting
COOL BEANS, BUT WHY SHOULD I WORK AT VOXTER?
We have an open culture where we openly share our results and where your input is truly valued
Working at Voxter means being part of a team that works hard, fast and has fun! We aim to keep growing as a company, as a team, and as individuals. Voxter is made up of truly exceptional people who found a career-making opportunity here
You get to be an integral part of building an amazing product and client experience, in a company big enough for growth but lean enough to get shit done!
Work-life balance is encouraged, and sometimes enforced! ;)
We offer flexible work schedules, an open vacation policy, and an extended benefits plan
Our shiny new Yaletown office - (complete with snacks and arcade!)
We have some of the cutest office dogs in Vancouver
Voxter is committed to paying very competitive salaries
We value the individuality and contribution of each of our team members. Collaboration, personality, growth, great results, and baked goods are wholeheartedly encouraged
THIS SOUNDS LIKE ME, SO WHAT’S NEXT?

If you’re interested in achieving great things at one of the most exciting companies, best workplaces and most fun and hardworking environments, we’d love to hear from you!

Oh, and we love that everyone is different, and we don’t want you to leave your personality at the door, so, in case it isn’t obvious, don’t be afraid to show your individuality, what sets you apart. We want to get to know YOU!

Software developer (JavaScript/Python),CA$46K-CA$57K (Glassdoor est.),"Say it takes 650 seconds to walk to your bus stop. Now, imagine leaving your house 649 seconds before your bus “should” arrive. You walk your normal pace, you turn the last corner, and just as you reach the stop—your bus pulls in.

It sounds amazing. Unlikely. Too good to be true. But thanks to our real-time data engineers, we’re closer than ever. Transit supports vehicle tracking in all major cities: we pull real-time data from agency servers, add some special sauce, then share those departure times with millions of riders. Will they have time for one more cup of coffee? Or will they have to sprint to the stop?

That’s for you to say: you’ll be unifying messy APIs, extracting relevant data, and linking it together with our static transit info. You’ll be scaling and refining our in-house prediction tools and algorithms. You’ll be merging agency real-time with crowdsourced data from millions of users. The fruits of your labour? Reliable real-time, no missed trips, and millions of happy riders. The extra coffee probably helped ;)

A note on diversity

Public transit is used by overwhelmingly more women and people of colour than other modes of transportation. We try to make sure the diversity of our users is reflected in the team that serves them. Because when we include people of all races, genders, sexual orientations, ages, and identities — we end up building a better app for everyone who uses Transit.

So if your lived experience has given you a unique perspective on all things transportation, mobility, accessibility, urbanism? Let us know, and we’ll make sure your application gets the attention it merits.

Responsibilities
Merge hundreds of 3rd party APIs in various formats (some clean as a whistle, others plain nasty) into a single, scalable, elegant API.
Develop strategies and tools that allow multiple sets of data to be cross-matched and merged if necessary.
Build algorithms that analyze historical data to predict accurate departure times.
Requirements
A minimum of 1 year or equivalent of JavaScript or Python.
Knowledge of object-oriented & functional programming.
Experience dealing with REST APIs (JSON, XML, GET, POST, etc)
Satisfactory communication skills in English and French.
Would-be-great-if section
Polyglot! The more languages you can speak, write and understand, the better.
Knowledge of Node.js, regexp, bash (bonus points for C++).
Comfortable with Kubernetes and Cloud deployments.
Used to work with Git and Github.
Passionate about cities, urbanism, public transit, design, technology, or all the above.
Experience dealing with multiple sources of data and different APIs.
Familiarity with transportation data formats like GTFS, GTFS-rt, NEPTUNE, TransitXChange...
Compensation & Benefits
Salary and stock options based on experience.
Comprehensive medical and dental coverage.
4 weeks vacation.
$1,500 annual mobility allowance. STM? BIXI? Uber? E-bike? Scooter? Going car-free is free at Transit.
Apple laptop and equipment
Work with highly skilled teammates in a ""let me teach you how to do that"" kind-of environment.
A training and development budget
Communal lunch-and-learn with free food on Fridays
Flexible work hours

We believe in the importance of an inclusive and diverse team. We welcome people of all ages, genders, ethnicities, orientations and backgrounds to apply.

Software Developer,CA$46K-CA$57K (Glassdoor est.),"HEY THERE VANCOUVER!

""Who is Voxter?"" You may be asking, well say farewell to Kansas Dorothy, because this might just blow you away.

We're a Vancouver based VOIP company that is on the rise and we are enthusiastically chucking out the old methods of business communication and replacing them with our shiny new platform and sophisticatedly simple software - which has been rocking the world of our business clients since we launched with our first customer in 2005. In short, we make business communication run smoother than a fresh jar of skippy.

Since 2005 we’ve grown to have hundreds of clients across the globe. We have POPs in San Jose, London, Tokyo, LA, Melbourne, Chicago, Toronto, and Vancouver (to name a few). Our goal is not only to continue to expand (we aim for world domination!), but to shake up how the world looks at business telecom and create an experience that our clients actually love to use!

Having been recently acquired by Ooma Inc, we’re poised for growth and ready to build out our already passionate and dedicated team.

And well, we’re hiring! We’re looking for a smart, critical thinker who is able to pick things up quickly to join the Engineering team as a Software Engineer. We’re not an ordinary company, so we don’t expect you to be ordinary either. If you love learning new stuff, enjoy digging into hard work and making the impossible happen - keep on reading!

SOUNDS NEAT, BUT WHAT WILL I DO IN THIS ROLE?

You'll be responsible for building and maintaining new and existing features in our distributed service architecture. We continue to build new features on top of a modern stack - it consists of a database layer (CouchDB), an application layer (Kazoo https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo and a number of other individual applications), an audio transcoding/call routing layer (FreeSWITCH), and an SBC/proxy layer (Kamailio). Many parts of this stack are written in the programming language Erlang. Communications between components is often over the AMQP protocol; specifically, we use RabbitMQ. In this role, you will spend most of your development time on Kazoo or the other peripherals in the application layer. This will include some front-end development as necessary (largely in AngularJS). We value moving fast and responding to change quickly, so don’t hesitate to propose adoption of new technologies that help us deliver value and functionality to our customers.
Of course, sometimes you might have to spend some time on a cool side-project! Some examples of projects members of our team have built include a fitness data aggregation application to encourage staff health activities, a Chrome browser extension that takes advantage of our platform APIs, or a Mario Kart 64 race stats collector!

Sound like you? Might be time for you to put your headphones on and snuggle down to code with your favourite office dog, or grab a pair programming partner, and code away the afternoon…

We have a talented engineering team  - people of all walks of life working on different projects. It’s like in a pirate ship, we may be a bunch of lunatics but we work as one, we pay attention and motivate each other, and often end the day with a good laugh. After all, you’re gonna need a team you can count on!

WHAT SHOULD MY BACKGROUND BE?
Associate's Degree or Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Business Information Systems, or similar field, or equivalent work experience required.
3+ years of development experience
Strong understanding of a typical full-service stack
Ability to perform code reviews, create detailed plans and willingness to work collaboratively with a development team.
Excellent technical, troubleshooting and analytical skills
VOIP / Telecommunications experience and an understanding of network topology and telecommunications architecture considered a plus
Ideal Technical Skills:
PHP
Node.js
Erlang
REST API experience
Distributed version control - Git on GitHub/Bitbucket
Linux (RedHat or derivative (CentOS))
HTML5 / CSS / Javascript / JSON
One or more client-side MVC frameworks with a preference for AngularJS (Backbone, Marionette, Ember, React)
Apache, Nginx
Familiar with both following and leading Agile / Scrum process
WHO DO I NEED TO BE TO KICK ASS IN THIS ROLE?
You love problem solving, puzzles and anything that makes you scratch your head!
You’re a coder with a good few years experience building stuff, but who isn’t afraid to learn, try new things, and challenge the status quo. Ideally you’ve got some experience in modern usages of multiple languages and frameworks (we use a lot of Erlang!). You use frameworks like AngularJS or RabbitMQ if they accelerate your work. You might have an embarrassing history with PHP , Bash, Python or Ruby. You’re intensely interested in the latest in cloud platforms, and you probably find time in your day to play with things like Elasticsearch. Maybe you’ve spent some time working with real-time distributed systems. Bonus points if you actually use these tools today, but if you don’t we’re happy to teach you.
You’ve got a few projects under your belt, and you’ve made some mistakes. We value people who learn from mistakes and improve themselves in tiny ways every day. But of course you don’t make the same mistakes over and over again because you know how to use automated tests and production monitoring to catch them next time around ;)
You might have your own side projects which display your love for tinkering, trying and learning new things. You’re also active in the open source community, have a github account and are excited to share with us some of the projects you’ve been working on!
You know how to get your work done without being micro-managed, because you use your initiative to do the right things at the right time. You love taking ownership of the problem and solution, collaborating and seeing it through to delivering value.
You value code accuracy, organization, and vetting

Problem-solving skills – Why? Because when you will face a problem, you will first analyze the information before identifying the possible causes. You will then explore and implement the most efficient and logical solutions.

Adaptability – Why? Because our industry evolves constantly. You will have to adjust your thinking and methods to better suit new or unplanned situations (whether it’s for your daily tasks or your work environment).

Here’s what you can expect from us.

Shortcutting your journey to your aspirations is possible when you surround yourself early on with knowledgeable and genuine people. We will put you in charge of important responsibilities from the beginning so that you can build your professional reputation. We will also help you quickly identify your strengths to build a strong foundation for your potential.

Software Developer,CA$91K-CA$116K (Glassdoor est.),"MetricAid is a small, high-functioning team that operates in the healthcare field. We provide scheduling services to hospitals that improve the quality of life for patients and physicians that very few companies provide.

We are looking to hire a talented software developer to join our growing team. As our business continues to grow, so does the demand for quality programmers. We are looking for a developer who has more than just a desire to write good code, but also a passion for creating great features!

Tech Stack:

PostgreSQL database
GoLang servers
Web application client (HTML/JS/CSS)

Needed skills/knowledge:

HTML/JS/CSS: Our web client is mostly raw HTML/JS/CSS (using jQuery/Semantic UI to assist). We believe in keeping the code straightforward and light on the client, so you don’t need to worry about any large frameworks.
JSON: Our application uses JSON as the primary form of inter-service communication and you will need to understand how the data is packaged and extracted.
UI/UX: Design is as important as development! Functionality is often hindered by design, so you will need to understand how to provide the user an environment that allows them to make the most of the functionality.
Relational Databases: You will often need to interact with our PostgreSQL database, and knowledge of any relational databases will allow you to deal with the data as required.

Helpful skills/knowledge:

GoLang: Nobody here knew Go when they were hired (maybe you will be the first!), so don’t worry if you aren’t familiar. Knowledge of C or any statically typed, compiled language will be helpful to get you started.
Microservices: Our system uses a series of microservices to spread out the code-base and distribute load. If you are comfortable with following logic paths across multiple services, you will feel right at home.
HTTP(S) Communication: Whether through communication with the client/server or server/server you will be making a lot of HTTP(S) calls and understanding the flow will help you follow the logic.
Templating: Our web pages are compiled server-side and understanding the process of template compilation will help you hit the ground running.

Your job will involve:

Writing/maintaining the code base for MetricAid’s scheduling portal
Contributing to/planning for features and improvements
Designing screens and interfaces for smooth UX
Working in a pseudo-scrum environment

The main reason people love working at Caredove is the impact they can have on thousands of patients and healthcare providers.

Have you ever lived through the process of getting a referral to an important health care service? The waiting, the phone tag, the mystery, the anxiety ... almost everybody has a horror story. We created Caredove to take the pain out of accessing home care and community services.

The Product - Caredove

It's really hard to connect with home care and community services, so people struggle even though there are health services out there that can help them. Caredove was built to make it easy to connect with these services.

Caredove is an online referral management platform that helps people search, book, and connect with home care and community services.

We want to bring a consumer-oriented approach to providing health care software, where our users love using what we build. We are excited about building Caredove and are looking for team members who share our passion for helping people who need care. We develop software that pays attention to the big and small details of people's experience when getting new health care services.

Software Developer,-1,"Downtime sucks. OpsLevel wants to make the Internet better by helping companies build more reliable software. We're building a product to bring the site reliability best practices from companies like Netflix and Google to everyone else.

We're an early stage startup based in Toronto, Canada. We're an experienced team of ex-Amazon, ex-Shopify, and ex-PagerDuty folks. We have paying customers and just closed our seed round with fantastic Silicon Valley investors.

Our users' experience is paramount, so we relentlessly focus on all aspects of UX, from our UI to our APIs. As developers, we also take great care with code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

Work/life balance is a priority for us. We have family, friends, and hobbies that we want to attend to at the end of the day (and we suspect you do too). Elon Musk can keep his 100 hour weeks. We're happy to grow fast at 40 hours per week.

We care a lot about culture. Here are our values:

Empathy: Think of others; think of your users
Growth Mindset: Get comfortable with being uncomfortable
Intellectual Honesty: The best solution is more important than anyone's ego
Focus & Efficiency: Keep the main thing the main thing
Simplicity

www.opslevel.com

You'll be working as a software developer on our core product and reporting directly to the CTO. OpsLevel integrates with various operational tools and we've got a meaty roadmap ahead of us and new integrations to build. Here are some sample technologies you could be integrating our product with:

Container orchestrators like Kubernetes and Consul
Services meshes like Istio / Envoy
Metrics tools like DataDog, Grafana, and Prometheus.

Your day to day will be writing software, but you'll ultimately touch various aspects of the business: talking to customers, defining new features, and then actually implementing those features end to end. We work in an agile way with minimal process / structure, so you should be good at working independently and getting stuff done.

You have a track record of making good engineering decisions. You improve those around you. You care about code quality and maintainability, but know when to tradeoff technical debt vs. building for the long term.

Here are some of the technologies we use:

Ruby on Rails
Vue.js

Your day to day will be writing software, but you'll ultimately touch various aspects of the business: talking to customers, defining new features, and then actually implementing those features end to end. We work in an agile way with minimal process / structure, so you should be good at working independently and getting stuff done.

You have a track record of making good engineering decisions. You improve those around you. You care about code quality and maintainability, but know when to tradeoff technical debt vs. building for the long term.

Le développement logiciel chez Orolia Canada s’effectue selon la méthodologie Agile. Les assignations de tâches sont quotidiennement revues lors du scrum matinal.

Les employés bénéficient d’horaires flexibles et ont le choix de travailler au bureau ou à domicile en fonction des tâches en cours. Notre local est situé dans un espace privé de WeWork sur l’Avenue des Canadiens-de-Montréal, en plein cœur du centre-ville de Montréal, très facile d’accès par transport en commun (situé en face du Centre Bell). WeWork offre un environnement de travail très moderne et stimulant, permettant aux employés de rencontrer et d’échanger avec des gens de plusieurs entreprises connexes.

Les conditions de travail sont très compétitives et favorisent la flexibilité et l’initiative des employés. Tout le matériel nécessaire à la réalisation des tâches est fourni par Orolia Canada: ordinateur avec carte graphique puissante, radio logicielle et récepteur GNSS.

À propos d’Orolia Canada

Fondée en 2014 (sous le nom Skydel Solutions), Orolia Canada est une compagnie offrant des logiciels de simulation GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System). En plus du système GPS, connu de tous, il existe d’autres systèmes GNSS tel que GLONASS (Russie), Galileo (Europe) et BeiDou (Chine). Chez Orolia Canada, nous avons conçu et mis en marché le premier simulateur GNSS entièrement logiciel (software-defined GNSS simulator). De manière générale, un simulateur GNSS est utilisé pour émettre des ondes radio identiques aux ondes radios transmises par les satellites GNSS, telles que perçues par un récepteur sur Terre ou en orbite autour de la Terre. Le simulateur GNSS est un outil très puissant pour assister à la conception de signaux satellitaires, de récepteurs GNSS ainsi que pour valider différents algorithmes de positionnement et de mitigation en cas de cyberattaque ou de brouillage.

Le simulateur GNSS Skydel utilise une technologie différente de ses compétiteurs: il ne requiert pas de plateforme propriétaire basée sur des FPGA. Il utilise plutôt du matériel commercial “off-the-shelf”: des cartes graphiques (GPU) pour en tirer une très grande puissance de calcul et des radios logicielles (SDR) pour émettre des ondes radio.

Depuis 2019, Orolia Canada fait partie du groupe Orolia, leader mondial dans les technologies de positionnement, localisation et temps. Les clients d’Orolia œuvrent dans des domaines très diversifiés (aérospatial, recherche universitaire, militaire) et sont présents dans toutes les régions du globe.",3.1,"Orolia

About Rewind

Rewind is a service that protects the data that is driving your business, from a simple side hustle to a successful venture. Our focus is on backing up data that lives in the cloud – in apps like Shopify, BigCommerce, and QuickBooks Online. We invite you to read our startup story to learn where we came from and where we’re going. For a more technical view, check out our Behind the App feature on the BigCommerce Developers Blog.

We care about honesty, we believe in learning from our mistakes, and we support each other as we grow.

ABOUT THE JOB

The development team at Rewind is made up of four small teams of 2 to 3 people; these people work together, collaboratively, to build new features and functions for our amazing customers.

In broad terms, each member of the team is responsible for the following:
Collaborating with other members of the development team to derive the best possible design to meet requirements
Implementing, testing, documenting, and maintaining back-end systems for multiple high-traffic services
Providing constructive feedback in the form of code and design reviews
Looking for ways to improve our development and deployment processes
Ensuring security and performance of our products
Day to day, you will work alongside other members of the team to bring new features to our growing list of services. Rewind is a large system made up of several components that all interwork in harmony. Some ideas we have in the backlog that have not made their way into our services include user management, action auditing, anomaly detection, dynamic reporting, exporting, trend analysis, real-time data translation, copy…

Developing reliable, securable, scalable, supportable code is a must. You will help put out some fires, especially the ones you accidentally created (we are big on accountability, you break it, you fix it), including incident response and remediation, but your main focus will be the reliability and robustness in all the things you help build. Less-flammable apps; fewer smouldering embers; automated fire suppression.

You need an observant eye for details, whether it’s with code, spelling, or something else entirely. Prove it to us – address your ""Why do you want to work with us"" question to Ms. Rails.

This job isn’t about moving heaven and earth. Yes, we want to be proud of running top-flight, healthy products, but we also want to be kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. Especially in crisis.

Here are some real examples of the work we’ve done lately that might help you to get a better idea of what this job entails:
Adoption of Shopify’s new versioned API - this one keeps us in business!
Support for Shopify’s new bulk APIs; this cut our operating costs (fewer servers) and increased the speed of our backups.
Rewind Copy for QuickBooks; #1 feature request for QuickBooks customers, move your data from here to there and make it easy.
Rewind API (version 1); services that want to power data resiliency in their apps with Rewind can now do so.
Hooking Hubspot into various areas of our product to capture customer events for sales/marketing.
Addressing multiple code and database scaling challenges in the processing of daily backups for our American BigCommerce customers.
Adding support for new entry level pricing plans that required creating limitations in product functionality.
Implementing a new first time user experience features to https://app.rewind.io.
Upgrading all applicable components from Rails 5 to Rails 6.
Enhancements to our administrative interface (the one that support, sales, and marketing rely on) to bundle customers, change billing plans, and cancel subscriptions.
Aggregating Webhooks with DynamoDB and SQS Delay Queues
ABOUT YOU

You are a perfect match for this role if you’re someone who possesses:
Great troubleshooting and analytical skills, you’re an exceptional communicator, you have prior experience building or maintaining Ruby on Rails-based applications, and you have a curious mind for how things work and what makes them tick.
You should enjoy making complicated situations simple and painless. You should be a stellar communicator, even when you have to communicate less-than-stellar news. You should have highly tuned senses of compassion and empathy and a drive to constantly help others.
You must be proficient in REST and GraphQL APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Linux, and major browser development tools. You should be well-versed in AWS, source control management (preferably Git), Docker, and one of either Ruby or Python.
You might have a CS degree. You might not. That’s not what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. A strong track record of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.
We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Rewind is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.

HOW TO APPLY

Please send an application that speaks directly to this position. There are no right answers or cookie-cutter expectations. Be authentic, be yourself, be creative, and take your time with the application. We want to see your personality. There’s no prize for being the first to submit! In our ""why you want to work with us question"", tell us briefly about:
why you want to work at Rewind and not somewhere else.
a time you taught yourself a new skill to complete a job or project.
some of the work we do; introduce yourself as a colleague and explain how you can help us
your favourite meal; why you love it and how you prepare it
Experience comes in many forms, many skills are transferable, and passion goes a long way. If your background is close to what we’re looking for, please consider applying, even if you aren’t able to check every box above. We are dedicated to diversity and providing an inclusive workplace for all and especially encourage members of underrepresented groups to apply.",4.9,"Rewind
