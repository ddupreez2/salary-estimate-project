You will be able to fully utilize your algorithms and data structure knowledge and/or experience continuously.

We are constantly experimenting with technologies; we are heavily engaged in development using Amazon AWS services, Node.js, and TypeScript.
Some Key Responsibilities: *

Software Developer,CA$82K-CA$90K (Glassdoor est.),"Since Ron Glozman founded Chisel AI in 2015 (see his full story here) we’ve evolved to be the machine learning leader in the insurance space. Our software reads insurance forms in milliseconds and extracts key policy information for some of the world’s largest companies. At Chisel AI, we make it possible for our customers to process data 400X faster than a human can; allowing them to focus on nuanced and interesting work that drives real value for their customers - which is now more important than ever.

The Opportunity

This may be your first step into the world of AI. As part of our growing Engineering team, you will be a fundamental part of building our core AI capabilities in an innovative greenfield environment where you are not saddled with a legacy of product debt. You will use your end to end product software development experience to tackle challenges that include building engineering pipelines, which help our machine learning scientists build better models. You will use modern web service, application logic, and UX development that enable those models to deliver large scale value to our customers.

Our Tech Stack

We deploy on AWS, and we build in Python and React. But that’s only part of the story. Bring your toolkit of expertise and help us make future choices to shape the technology environment and tools here.

Our new Software Developer will:

Build. You will build the core AI capabilities and wrappers that deliver an innovative, scalable and reliable product solution that our team is proud to declare ownership of.
Learn. You will apply deep computer science concepts daily and work closely with all of our teams to better understand and deliver our AI capabilities.
Grow. You will own processes, make decisions, support your colleagues and develop your career in ways that you didn’t know possible through our unique stage of business growth. And you will do it with a team who understands that the best version of you needs the flexibility and support to thrive both inside and outside of work.

So, how do we know you are the next Software Developer? You have:

The experience. You bring a minimum of 3 to 5 years of experience developing commercial software using an object-oriented language including exposure to shipping product zero, which has ultimately been used on a large scale. You combine this experience with a strong willingness to dive in to figure out the right approaches and pivot quickly.
The expertise. You think at a systems-level and are well-versed in service-oriented architecture, message bus, AWS, Docker, and containerization frameworks. You have mastered enough technology to tackle problems and new tools in a way that inspires confidence in others.
The drive and curiosity. You are motivated, resourceful, and ambitious. You want to build out your skills and your career with Chisel AI.
The flexibility. You are quick to adapt when priorities shift and take feedback well. You are comfortable with ambiguity and are willing to figure things out when there’s no clear, defined path or process outlined.

So what do you need to know about Chisel AI?

We are technology enthusiasts and experts pushing the limits on how AI will shape the future of insurance. Having successfully raised one of the largest seed rounds in Canadian history and with partners like Venrock, a leading Silicon Valley venture firm, by our side very little stands in the way of our success.

We’ve been recognized by several of the top accelerators in Canada including Creative Destruction Labs and the DMZ and were crowned the winner of the ACORD Global InsurTech Innovation Challenge in 2018. All of which just marked the start of our momentum as in 2019, we won gold at the Zurich Innovation World Championship and made the CIX Top 20 Early Companies list celebrating the most innovative technology companies in Canada.

Why join Chisel AI?

We’re a company with heavy traction, big clients, and a plan to expand rapidly. We’ve assembled a strong and diverse leadership team and are poised to scale and develop talented people of all levels. This is a place where failures turn into opportunities, where we learn from each other and where everyone’s voice is heard. We’re at a unique and rare stage of growth that will give our team and those who join us a chance to put their mark on everything we build.

What you can expect when you apply to Chisel AI

We know that diversity and belonging makes for the best problem solving and creative thinking.

Software Developer,CA$78K-CA$90K (Glassdoor est.),"HEY THERE VANCOUVER!

""Who is Voxter?"" You may be asking, well say farewell to Kansas Dorothy, because this might just blow you away.

We're a Vancouver based VOIP company that is on the rise and we are enthusiastically chucking out the old methods of business communication and replacing them with our shiny new platform and sophisticatedly simple software - which has been rocking the world of our business clients since we launched with our first customer in 2005. In short, we make business communication run smoother than a fresh jar of skippy.

Since 2005 we’ve grown to have hundreds of clients across the globe. We have POPs in San Jose, London, Tokyo, LA, Melbourne, Chicago, Toronto, and Vancouver (to name a few). Our goal is not only to continue to expand (we aim for world domination!), but to shake up how the world looks at business telecom and create an experience that our clients actually love to use!

Having been recently acquired by Ooma Inc, we’re poised for growth and ready to build out our already passionate and dedicated team.

And well, we’re hiring! We’re looking for a smart, critical thinker who is able to pick things up quickly to join the Engineering team as a Software Engineer. We’re not an ordinary company, so we don’t expect you to be ordinary either. If you love learning new stuff, enjoy digging into hard work and making the impossible happen - keep on reading!

SOUNDS NEAT, BUT WHAT WILL I DO IN THIS ROLE?

You'll be responsible for building and maintaining new and existing features in our distributed service architecture. We continue to build new features on top of a modern stack - it consists of a database layer (CouchDB), an application layer (Kazoo https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo and a number of other individual applications), an audio transcoding/call routing layer (FreeSWITCH), and an SBC/proxy layer (Kamailio). Many parts of this stack are written in the programming language Erlang. Communications between components is often over the AMQP protocol; specifically, we use RabbitMQ. In this role, you will spend most of your development time on Kazoo or the other peripherals in the application layer. This will include some front-end development as necessary (largely in AngularJS). We value moving fast and responding to change quickly, so don’t hesitate to propose adoption of new technologies that help us deliver value and functionality to our customers.
Of course, sometimes you might have to spend some time on a cool side-project! Some examples of projects members of our team have built include a fitness data aggregation application to encourage staff health activities, a Chrome browser extension that takes advantage of our platform APIs, or a Mario Kart 64 race stats collector!

Sound like you? Might be time for you to put your headphones on and snuggle down to code with your favourite office dog, or grab a pair programming partner, and code away the afternoon…

We have a talented engineering team  - people of all walks of life working on different projects. It’s like in a pirate ship, we may be a bunch of lunatics but we work as one, we pay attention and motivate each other, and often end the day with a good laugh. After all, you’re gonna need a team you can count on!

WHAT SHOULD MY BACKGROUND BE?
Associate's Degree or Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Business Information Systems, or similar field, or equivalent work experience required.
3+ years of development experience
Strong understanding of a typical full-service stack
Ability to perform code reviews, create detailed plans and willingness to work collaboratively with a development team.
Excellent technical, troubleshooting and analytical skills
VOIP / Telecommunications experience and an understanding of network topology and telecommunications architecture considered a plus
Ideal Technical Skills:
PHP
Node.js
Erlang
REST API experience
Distributed version control - Git on GitHub/Bitbucket
Linux (RedHat or derivative (CentOS))
HTML5 / CSS / Javascript / JSON
One or more client-side MVC frameworks with a preference for AngularJS (Backbone, Marionette, Ember, React)
Apache, Nginx
Familiar with both following and leading Agile / Scrum process
WHO DO I NEED TO BE TO KICK ASS IN THIS ROLE?
You love problem solving, puzzles and anything that makes you scratch your head!
You’re a coder with a good few years experience building stuff, but who isn’t afraid to learn, try new things, and challenge the status quo. Ideally you’ve got some experience in modern usages of multiple languages and frameworks (we use a lot of Erlang!). You use frameworks like AngularJS or RabbitMQ if they accelerate your work. You might have an embarrassing history with PHP , Bash, Python or Ruby. You’re intensely interested in the latest in cloud platforms, and you probably find time in your day to play with things like Elasticsearch. Maybe you’ve spent some time working with real-time distributed systems. Bonus points if you actually use these tools today, but if you don’t we’re happy to teach you.
You’ve got a few projects under your belt, and you’ve made some mistakes. We value people who learn from mistakes and improve themselves in tiny ways every day. But of course you don’t make the same mistakes over and over again because you know how to use automated tests and production monitoring to catch them next time around ;)
You might have your own side projects which display your love for tinkering, trying and learning new things. You’re also active in the open source community, have a github account and are excited to share with us some of the projects you’ve been working on!
You know how to get your work done without being micro-managed, because you use your initiative to do the right things at the right time. You love taking ownership of the problem and solution, collaborating and seeing it through to delivering value.
You value code accuracy, organization, and vetting
COOL BEANS, BUT WHY SHOULD I WORK AT VOXTER?
We have an open culture where we openly share our results and where your input is truly valued
Working at Voxter means being part of a team that works hard, fast and has fun! We aim to keep growing as a company, as a team, and as individuals. Voxter is made up of truly exceptional people who found a career-making opportunity here
You get to be an integral part of building an amazing product and client experience, in a company big enough for growth but lean enough to get shit done!
Work-life balance is encouraged, and sometimes enforced! ;)
We offer flexible work schedules, an open vacation policy, and an extended benefits plan
Our shiny new Yaletown office - (complete with snacks and arcade!)
We have some of the cutest office dogs in Vancouver
Voxter is committed to paying very competitive salaries
We value the individuality and contribution of each of our team members. Collaboration, personality, growth, great results, and baked goods are wholeheartedly encouraged

You walk your normal pace, you turn the last corner, and just as you reach the stop—your bus pulls in.

It sounds amazing. Unlikely. Too good to be true. But thanks to our real-time data engineers, we’re closer than ever. Transit supports vehicle tracking in all major cities: we pull real-time data from agency servers, add some special sauce, then share those departure times with millions of riders. Will they have time for one more cup of coffee? Or will they have to sprint to the stop?

That’s for you to say: you’ll be unifying messy APIs, extracting relevant data, and linking it together with our static transit info. You’ll be scaling and refining our in-house prediction tools and algorithms. You’ll be merging agency real-time with crowdsourced data from millions of users. The fruits of your labour? Reliable real-time, no missed trips, and millions of happy riders. The extra coffee probably helped ;)

A note on diversity

Public transit is used by overwhelmingly more women and people of colour than other modes of transportation. We try to make sure the diversity of our users is reflected in the team that serves them. Because when we include people of all races, genders, sexual orientations, ages, and identities — we end up building a better app for everyone who uses Transit.

So if your lived experience has given you a unique perspective on all things transportation, mobility, accessibility, urbanism? Let us know, and we’ll make sure your application gets the attention it merits.

Responsibilities
Merge hundreds of 3rd party APIs in various formats (some clean as a whistle, others plain nasty) into a single, scalable, elegant API.
Develop strategies and tools that allow multiple sets of data to be cross-matched and merged if necessary.
Build algorithms that analyze historical data to predict accurate departure times.
Requirements
A minimum of 1 year or equivalent of JavaScript or Python.
Knowledge of object-oriented & functional programming.
Experience dealing with REST APIs (JSON, XML, GET, POST, etc)
Satisfactory communication skills in English and French.
Would-be-great-if section
Polyglot! The more languages you can speak, write and understand, the better.
Knowledge of Node.js, regexp, bash (bonus points for C++).
Comfortable with Kubernetes and Cloud deployments.
Used to work with Git and Github.
Passionate about cities, urbanism, public transit, design, technology, or all the above.
Experience dealing with multiple sources of data and different APIs.
Familiarity with transportation data formats like GTFS, GTFS-rt, NEPTUNE, TransitXChange...
Compensation & Benefits
Salary and stock options based on experience.
Comprehensive medical and dental coverage.
4 weeks vacation.
$1,500 annual mobility allowance. STM? BIXI? Uber? E-bike? Scooter? Going car-free is free at Transit.
Apple laptop and equipment
Work with highly skilled teammates in a ""let me teach you how to do that"" kind-of environment.
A training and development budget
Communal lunch-and-learn with free food on Fridays

Software Developer,CA$46K-CA$57K (Glassdoor est.),"HEY THERE VANCOUVER!

""Who is Voxter?"" You may be asking, well say farewell to Kansas Dorothy, because this might just blow you away.

We're a Vancouver based VOIP company that is on the rise and we are enthusiastically chucking out the old methods of business communication and replacing them with our shiny new platform and sophisticatedly simple software - which has been rocking the world of our business clients since we launched with our first customer in 2005. In short, we make business communication run smoother than a fresh jar of skippy.

Since 2005 we’ve grown to have hundreds of clients across the globe. We have POPs in San Jose, London, Tokyo, LA, Melbourne, Chicago, Toronto, and Vancouver (to name a few). Our goal is not only to continue to expand (we aim for world domination!), but to shake up how the world looks at business telecom and create an experience that our clients actually love to use!

Having been recently acquired by Ooma Inc, we’re poised for growth and ready to build out our already passionate and dedicated team.

And well, we’re hiring! We’re looking for a smart, critical thinker who is able to pick things up quickly to join the Engineering team as a Software Engineer. We’re not an ordinary company, so we don’t expect you to be ordinary either. If you love learning new stuff, enjoy digging into hard work and making the impossible happen - keep on reading!

SOUNDS NEAT, BUT WHAT WILL I DO IN THIS ROLE?

You'll be responsible for building and maintaining new and existing features in our distributed service architecture. We continue to build new features on top of a modern stack - it consists of a database layer (CouchDB), an application layer (Kazoo https://github.com/2600hz/kazoo and a number of other individual applications), an audio transcoding/call routing layer (FreeSWITCH), and an SBC/proxy layer (Kamailio). Many parts of this stack are written in the programming language Erlang. Communications between components is often over the AMQP protocol; specifically, we use RabbitMQ. In this role, you will spend most of your development time on Kazoo or the other peripherals in the application layer. This will include some front-end development as necessary (largely in AngularJS). We value moving fast and responding to change quickly, so don’t hesitate to propose adoption of new technologies that help us deliver value and functionality to our customers.
Of course, sometimes you might have to spend some time on a cool side-project! Some examples of projects members of our team have built include a fitness data aggregation application to encourage staff health activities, a Chrome browser extension that takes advantage of our platform APIs, or a Mario Kart 64 race stats collector!

Sound like you? Might be time for you to put your headphones on and snuggle down to code with your favourite office dog, or grab a pair programming partner, and code away the afternoon…

We have a talented engineering team  - people of all walks of life working on different projects. It’s like in a pirate ship, we may be a bunch of lunatics but we work as one, we pay attention and motivate each other, and often end the day with a good laugh. After all, you’re gonna need a team you can count on!

WHAT SHOULD MY BACKGROUND BE?
Associate's Degree or Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Business Information Systems, or similar field, or equivalent work experience required.
3+ years of development experience
Strong understanding of a typical full-service stack
Ability to perform code reviews, create detailed plans and willingness to work collaboratively with a development team.
Excellent technical, troubleshooting and analytical skills
VOIP / Telecommunications experience and an understanding of network topology and telecommunications architecture considered a plus
Ideal Technical Skills:
PHP
Node.js
Erlang
REST API experience
Distributed version control - Git on GitHub/Bitbucket
Linux (RedHat or derivative (CentOS))
HTML5 / CSS / Javascript / JSON
One or more client-side MVC frameworks with a preference for AngularJS (Backbone, Marionette, Ember, React)
Apache, Nginx
Familiar with both following and leading Agile / Scrum process
WHO DO I NEED TO BE TO KICK ASS IN THIS ROLE?
You love problem solving, puzzles and anything that makes you scratch your head!
You’re a coder with a good few years experience building stuff, but who isn’t afraid to learn, try new things, and challenge the status quo. Ideally you’ve got some experience in modern usages of multiple languages and frameworks (we use a lot of Erlang!). You use frameworks like AngularJS or RabbitMQ if they accelerate your work. You might have an embarrassing history with PHP , Bash, Python or Ruby. You’re intensely interested in the latest in cloud platforms, and you probably find time in your day to play with things like Elasticsearch. Maybe you’ve spent some time working with real-time distributed systems. Bonus points if you actually use these tools today, but if you don’t we’re happy to teach you.
You’ve got a few projects under your belt, and you’ve made some mistakes. We value people who learn from mistakes and improve themselves in tiny ways every day. But of course you don’t make the same mistakes over and over again because you know how to use automated tests and production monitoring to catch them next time around ;)
You might have your own side projects which display your love for tinkering, trying and learning new things. You’re also active in the open source community, have a github account and are excited to share with us some of the projects you’ve been working on!
You know how to get your work done without being micro-managed, because you use your initiative to do the right things at the right time. You love taking ownership of the problem and solution, collaborating and seeing it through to delivering value.
You value code accuracy, organization, and vetting
COOL BEANS, BUT WHY SHOULD I WORK AT VOXTER?
We have an open culture where we openly share our results and where your input is truly valued
Working at Voxter means being part of a team that works hard, fast and has fun! We aim to keep growing as a company, as a team, and as individuals. Voxter is made up of truly exceptional people who found a career-making opportunity here
You get to be an integral part of building an amazing product and client experience, in a company big enough for growth but lean enough to get shit done!
Work-life balance is encouraged, and sometimes enforced! ;)
We offer flexible work schedules, an open vacation policy, and an extended benefits plan
Our shiny new Yaletown office - (complete with snacks and arcade!)
We have some of the cutest office dogs in Vancouver
Voxter is committed to paying very competitive salaries
We value the individuality and contribution of each of our team members. Collaboration, personality, growth, great results, and baked goods are wholeheartedly encouraged
THIS SOUNDS LIKE ME, SO WHAT’S NEXT?

If you’re interested in achieving great things at one of the most exciting companies, best workplaces and most fun and hardworking environments, we’d love to hear from you!

Oh, and we love that everyone is different, and we don’t want you to leave your personality at the door, so, in case it isn’t obvious, don’t be afraid to show your individuality, what sets you apart. We want to get to know YOU!

Here’s what we do and why we do it.

Simply put, we will work together to simplify businesses’ IT with cloud technology so they can focus on what really matters, making people’s lives better. Discover how we do that here: www.sherweb.com/about/

Here’s how you can contribute to the company's success.

Our team goal is to develop useful products so people can work better. You will contribute to this goal by developing products, software solutions and applications for transactional and administrative functions. Succeeding in this role involves efficiently developing solutions that deliver real value to the company. To do this you will collaborate with the entire product development team.

Here’s what your day-to-day in this role will look like:

Participate in defining functionalities for new products.
Create and implement new features in our ecosystem.

If you have these skills, you will fit right in with us:

Communication skills – Why? Because you will be expected to explain and vulgarize concepts by adapting the style and content of your messages to your audience (whether it’s internal client, external clients or your teammates).

Problem-solving skills – Why? Because when you will face a problem, you will first analyze the information before identifying the possible causes. You will then explore and implement the most efficient and logical solutions.

Adaptability – Why? Because our industry evolves constantly. You will have to adjust your thinking and methods to better suit new or unplanned situations (whether it’s for your daily tasks or your work environment).

Here’s what you can expect from us.

Shortcutting your journey to your aspirations is possible when you surround yourself early on with knowledgeable and genuine people. We will put you in charge of important responsibilities from the beginning so that you can build your professional reputation. We will also help you quickly identify your strengths to build a strong foundation for your potential.

This is our team philosophy.

Software Developer,CA$91K-CA$116K (Glassdoor est.),"MetricAid is a small, high-functioning team that operates in the healthcare field. We provide scheduling services to hospitals that improve the quality of life for patients and physicians that very few companies provide.

We are looking to hire a talented software developer to join our growing team. As our business continues to grow, so does the demand for quality programmers. We are looking for a developer who has more than just a desire to write good code, but also a passion for creating great features!

Tech Stack:

PostgreSQL database
GoLang servers
Web application client (HTML/JS/CSS)

Needed skills/knowledge:

HTML/JS/CSS: Our web client is mostly raw HTML/JS/CSS (using jQuery/Semantic UI to assist). We believe in keeping the code straightforward and light on the client, so you don’t need to worry about any large frameworks.
JSON: Our application uses JSON as the primary form of inter-service communication and you will need to understand how the data is packaged and extracted.
UI/UX: Design is as important as development! Functionality is often hindered by design, so you will need to understand how to provide the user an environment that allows them to make the most of the functionality.
Relational Databases: You will often need to interact with our PostgreSQL database, and knowledge of any relational databases will allow you to deal with the data as required.

Helpful skills/knowledge:

GoLang: Nobody here knew Go when they were hired (maybe you will be the first!), so don’t worry if you aren’t familiar. Knowledge of C or any statically typed, compiled language will be helpful to get you started.
Microservices: Our system uses a series of microservices to spread out the code-base and distribute load. If you are comfortable with following logic paths across multiple services, you will feel right at home.
HTTP(S) Communication: Whether through communication with the client/server or server/server you will be making a lot of HTTP(S) calls and understanding the flow will help you follow the logic.
Templating: Our web pages are compiled server-side and understanding the process of template compilation will help you hit the ground running.

Your job will involve:

Writing/maintaining the code base for MetricAid’s scheduling portal
Contributing to/planning for features and improvements
Designing screens and interfaces for smooth UX
Working in a pseudo-scrum environment

About Rewind

Rewind is a service that protects the data that is driving your business, from a simple side hustle to a successful venture. Our focus is on backing up data that lives in the cloud – in apps like Shopify, BigCommerce, and QuickBooks Online. We invite you to read our startup story to learn where we came from and where we’re going. For a more technical view, check out our Behind the App feature on the BigCommerce Developers Blog.

We care about honesty, we believe in learning from our mistakes, and we support each other as we grow.

ABOUT THE JOB

The development team at Rewind is made up of four small teams of 2 to 3 people; these people work together, collaboratively, to build new features and functions for our amazing customers.

In broad terms, each member of the team is responsible for the following:
Collaborating with other members of the development team to derive the best possible design to meet requirements
Implementing, testing, documenting, and maintaining back-end systems for multiple high-traffic services
Providing constructive feedback in the form of code and design reviews
Looking for ways to improve our development and deployment processes
Ensuring security and performance of our products
Day to day, you will work alongside other members of the team to bring new features to our growing list of services. Rewind is a large system made up of several components that all interwork in harmony. Some ideas we have in the backlog that have not made their way into our services include user management, action auditing, anomaly detection, dynamic reporting, exporting, trend analysis, real-time data translation, copy…

Developing reliable, securable, scalable, supportable code is a must. You will help put out some fires, especially the ones you accidentally created (we are big on accountability, you break it, you fix it), including incident response and remediation, but your main focus will be the reliability and robustness in all the things you help build. Less-flammable apps; fewer smouldering embers; automated fire suppression.

You need an observant eye for details, whether it’s with code, spelling, or something else entirely. Prove it to us – address your ""Why do you want to work with us"" question to Ms. Rails.

This job isn’t about moving heaven and earth. Yes, we want to be proud of running top-flight, healthy products, but we also want to be kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. Especially in crisis.

Here are some real examples of the work we’ve done lately that might help you to get a better idea of what this job entails:
Adoption of Shopify’s new versioned API - this one keeps us in business!
Support for Shopify’s new bulk APIs; this cut our operating costs (fewer servers) and increased the speed of our backups.
Rewind Copy for QuickBooks; #1 feature request for QuickBooks customers, move your data from here to there and make it easy.
Rewind API (version 1); services that want to power data resiliency in their apps with Rewind can now do so.
Hooking Hubspot into various areas of our product to capture customer events for sales/marketing.
Addressing multiple code and database scaling challenges in the processing of daily backups for our American BigCommerce customers.
Adding support for new entry level pricing plans that required creating limitations in product functionality.
Implementing a new first time user experience features to https://app.rewind.io.
Upgrading all applicable components from Rails 5 to Rails 6.
Enhancements to our administrative interface (the one that support, sales, and marketing rely on) to bundle customers, change billing plans, and cancel subscriptions.
Aggregating Webhooks with DynamoDB and SQS Delay Queues
ABOUT YOU

You are a perfect match for this role if you’re someone who possesses:
Great troubleshooting and analytical skills, you’re an exceptional communicator, you have prior experience building or maintaining Ruby on Rails-based applications, and you have a curious mind for how things work and what makes them tick.
You should enjoy making complicated situations simple and painless. You should be a stellar communicator, even when you have to communicate less-than-stellar news. You should have highly tuned senses of compassion and empathy and a drive to constantly help others.
You must be proficient in REST and GraphQL APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, Linux, and major browser development tools. You should be well-versed in AWS, source control management (preferably Git), Docker, and one of either Ruby or Python.
You might have a CS degree. You might not. That’s not what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. A strong track record of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.
We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Rewind is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.

HOW TO APPLY

Please send an application that speaks directly to this position. There are no right answers or cookie-cutter expectations. Be authentic, be yourself, be creative, and take your time with the application. We want to see your personality. There’s no prize for being the first to submit! In our ""why you want to work with us question"", tell us briefly about:
why you want to work at Rewind and not somewhere else.
a time you taught yourself a new skill to complete a job or project.
some of the work we do; introduce yourself as a colleague and explain how you can help us
your favourite meal; why you love it and how you prepare it
Experience comes in many forms, many skills are transferable, and passion goes a long way. If your background is close to what we’re looking for, please consider applying, even if you aren’t able to check every box above. We are dedicated to diversity and providing an inclusive workplace for all and especially encourage members of underrepresented groups to apply.",4.9,"Rewind

We provide both the ability for parking providers to set up parking rules through an admin API, as well as a quoting API that tells the apps how much a parking session is going to cost. Our APIs process an average of over 5 million requests per day and are used by a global audience.

Here's what you'll do:
Leave your fingerprints on the design of products, architect our infrastructure, and improve technical documentation
Write code and mentor teammates as they test-drive code for new features and bug fixes
Work with product management and client services to scope out work and define acceptance criteria
Participate in code reviews to share expertise with the team, ensure code quality, and verify PCI compliance
Participate in mob and pair-programming sessions to distribute knowledge across the team and collaborate on finding solutions to complex problems
Provision and maintain cloud infrastructure for your team's products
Monitor the health and success of your team's products through application and system metrics
Own the success of the systems you and your team develop. This includes monitoring, investigating issues, and supporting the service during outages
The must-haves:
5+ years' experience designing, developing, and maintaining scalable production software that stands up to real-world users and production conditions
An excellent understanding of software engineering techniques
Strong ability to write code in C# (.NET Framework, .NET Core) and/or Node.js
Experience with cloud platforms and cloud native (docker, serverless) development (AWS preferred)
Worked in an agile development environment following Scrum
Experience designing and implementing Web APIs
Keep up with new technologies and find ways to improve the status quo
Collaborative approach to decision-making
Good communication skills; work effectively within the team (with both remote and local team members) as well as with other teams
The nice to haves:
Experience with SOA and/or microservices architecture and messaging patterns
Familiarity with Domain Driven Design patterns and principles
Ability to define Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
Experience with TDD/BDD practices
Experience with production monitoring, observability, and metrics
Success in this role looks like:
You identify business requirements and drive work all the way from technical design to development, code review, and deployment into production
Your code is SOLID
You work with the team to develop and uphold coding standards
You participate in the team's on-call rotation, but since you build robust software this does not disrupt your work-life balance
About us:

Here at PayByPhone, our strength is in our people: a talented team behind a fantastic product. We are a creative, ambitious and driven multi-disciplinary group. We value learning and fun as we innovate to help millions of consumers pay for parking easily and securely. Our teams are growing; but not without you.

Together, we're on a mission to simplify the world of mobility payments – one parking spot at a time. We're one of the fastest-growing mobile payment companies in the world and process over 90 million parking, transit, and bike-share transactions a year in cities across North America, Europe and Australia. Our teams help millions of consumers easily and securely pay for parking and transportation without the hassles of waiting in line, carrying change, or risking costly fines.

Now, with a recent acquisition by Volkswagen Financial Services, our growth has a global focus and we can't do it alone. We need the right people working with us to help reach our lofty goals and we want it to be you.
